===================================

NAME
    Image::Magick::Thumbnail - produces thumbnail images with ImageMagick

SYNOPSIS
            use Image::Magick::Thumbnail;
            # Load your source image
            my $src = new Image::Magick;
            $src->Read('source.jpg');

            # Create the thumbnail from it, where the biggest side is 50 px
            my ($thumb,$x,$y) = Image::Magick::Thumbnail::create($src,50);

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses the ImageMagick library to create a thumbnail image
    with no side bigger than you specify.

    The subroutine "create" takes two arguments: the first is an ImageMagick
    image object, the second is the size, in pixels, you wish the image's
    longest side to be. It returns an ImaegMagick image object (the
    thumbnail), as well as the number of pixels of the *width* and *height*
    of the image, as integer scalars.
