Image/Magick/Thumbnail version 0.02
===================================

Produces thumbnail images with ImageMagick.

This version catches a couple of operator errors, as well as offering
an attempt at accepting IM geometry. I've not really had a chance to
test this, and am not sure it what the requestor wanted, but ... well,
let me know.
